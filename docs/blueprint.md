## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Medium blue (#4681C0), suggesting trust, reliability, and professionalism, qualities appropriate for a business tool.
- Background color: Light blue (#E8F0FE), provides a clean, calming backdrop.
- Accent color: A vibrant, slightly darker shade of cyan (#43BFC7), will draw attention to interactive elements and key information.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headings and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body. The former gives a clean, geometric, modern look that's good for titles, while the latter is humanist and conveys information well in long blocks of text.
- Use a set of minimalist icons for actions and categories.
- Kanban boards for lead tracking with drag-and-drop functionality.
- Subtle transitions for stage changes and updates.
